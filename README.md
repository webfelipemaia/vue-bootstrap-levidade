# vue-bootstrap-levidade

This is a set of Vue+Bootstrap components for use in my personal projects.

Note that this version of Bootstrap adapted for Vue is a prototype and should be evaluated and modified if used for production applications.

## Development configuration

For more details on customizing components you can consult the [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) documentation. To install, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
